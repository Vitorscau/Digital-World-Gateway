  description_: A lesser bulb Digimon with a huge flower blooming on its head. It
    can move around by swinging its root-shaped feelers, and can even float through
    the air for short distances. Its curious nature and upbeat movements make for
    an adorable figure. They tend to live in packs, numbering somewhere between the
    dozens and hundreds.
